      <description>(I was an validator of the Medalla testnet. Yes, &amp;ldquo;was&amp;rdquo;. After an upgrade of the Prysm client, there was something wrong and I could not fix it. After that, I recklessly deleted the whole Ubuntu OS. I need to be honest. :0 )

      <description>Moby-Dick; or, The Whale is an 1851 novel by American writer Herman Melville. The book is the sailor Ishmael&amp;rsquo;s narrative of the obsessive quest of Ahab, captain of the whaling ship Pequod, for revenge on Moby Dick, the giant white sperm whale that on the ship&amp;rsquo;s previous voyage bit off Ahab&amp;rsquo;s leg at the knee. A contribution to the literature of the American Renaissance, Moby-Dick was published to mixed reviews, was a commercial failure, and was out of print at the time of the author&amp;rsquo;s death in 1891.</description>
