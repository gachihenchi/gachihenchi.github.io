After an upgrade  of the client, there was something wrong and I could not fix it. I need to be honest. :0 )</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This series of articles is only write for fun cause I just write down what I learned. Oh, these posts may have some mistakes and be outdated in the future. Just don&rsquo;t be serious though I am convinced that I explain it very well and deeply. :)</p>

<p>“As I understand it, we are good to go: deposit contract in the next few days; beacon chain genesis 6-8 weeks later.” said by ConsenSys developer Ben Edgington <a href="https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/eth2_news/https%3A%2F%2Fhackmd.io%2F%40benjaminion%2Fwnie2_201018">on his blog on 18 October 2020</a> . (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-2-0-deposit-contract-to-launch-this-week-consensys-dev">See more info</a>) Though It&rsquo;s not an official statement and probably a little bit optimistic, it seems that we are very close to the ETH 2.0 phase 0 launch. So  let&rsquo;s try to explain phase 0 first in this article.</p>
<h1 id="phase-0-the-beacon-chain">Phase 0: the beacon chain</h1>
<p>There are many great and primary explainers about what is the beacon chain and I pick one for you.</p>
